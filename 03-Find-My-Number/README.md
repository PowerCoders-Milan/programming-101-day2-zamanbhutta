# Find my number!

```
I am thinking of an integer between 1 and 100. Your task is to find this number by asking me questions of the form 
"Is your number higher, lower or equal to x" for different numbers x.
```

1. Describe input and output
2. List the steps of an algorithm that solves the guessing problem
3. How many steps do you need?
4. Can you think of a mathematical formula your algorithm is based on?

Write the pseudocode in find_my_number.js

[Open Blockly](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/code/index.html) and solve with Blockly

When you've finished the exercise, remember to paste the JS code in find_my_number.js, commit and push.

Stuck? --> it is a complicated problem, try google :)
